# CP1404 Practical Reflection

**What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?**
70%

**What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?**
Tues & Thu 7:00–8:00 pm (Australia/Brisbane) at my desk, 2×1-hour blocks each week. I also leave a 30-min catch-up slot on Sunday afternoon.

**What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?**
- Keeping a clean repo: one folder per prac, correct filenames.
- Writing functions with SRP, no globals, clear docstrings, and a `main()` entry point.
- Testing with edge cases (e.g., score 0/50/90/100, temperature boundaries).
- Using PyCharm refactor tools (Extract Method) and heeding PEP 8 warnings.

**What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?**
- Stop editing directly on GitHub web; do all coding and commits via PyCharm.
- Avoid large “dump everything” commits—commit smaller milestones with clear messages.
- Don’t leave lectures to “later”; follow my fixed viewing schedule.

**What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?**
- Pushing late (end of day) instead of after each milestone.
- Inconsistent input validation in a few scripts—will standardise simple loops for checks.
- Sometimes mixing weeks in one commit—will tick only files from the active `prac_xx/`.

**What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?**
- Translating requirements into small, reusable functions and adding docstrings.
- Keeping filenames and folder structure exactly as per Deliverables.
- Clear, imperative commit messages (e.g., “Add prac 02 deliverables …”).
- Using menus/patterns from the notes and refactoring earlier code instead of rewriting.
